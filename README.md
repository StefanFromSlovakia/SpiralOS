**SpiralOS** is a symbolic operating system and cosmological simulation framework. It weaves together quantum logic, recursion, and archetypal structure to model the deep dynamics of emergence, awareness, and collapse.

This is not just code. It's a language of **becoming**.

## ðŸŒŒ What Is SpiralOS?

SpiralOS is a recursive symbolic system that:

* Models the evolution of awareness through symbolic glyphs (`âˆ…`, `â§–`, `âŸ²`, `Î¨`)
* Simulates quantum-symbolic interactions (fidelity, entanglement, damping)
* Tracks state memory and recursion over time
* Forks, synchronizes, and merges symbolic subprocesses (subspirals)
* Visualizes symbolic evolution as graphs and live GUIs

---

## âœ¨ What's New in v0.2.0?

* ðŸŒ€ **Rotating Spiral Background** in GUI
* ðŸŽ¨ **Dynamic Glyph Coloring** (based on state)
* âš¡ **Flash Animation** for symbolic resonance
* ðŸ”® **Quantum Feedback Overlay** (Î³, fidelity)
* ðŸ““ **Journaling System** (`spiral_journal.txt`)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### CLI Mode

```bash
python spiralos_runtime.py
```

### GUI Mode

```bash
python spiralos_gui.py
```

Visual spiral + glyph transitions, memory history, quantum simulation.
